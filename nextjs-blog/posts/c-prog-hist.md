<p>C is a procedural general-purpose programming language that was originally created by Dennis Ritchie in 1972 in Bell Laboratories of AT&T Labs. It was originally intended as a system programming language to implement the UNIX system. C has become one of the world's most influential programming languages that is universally applied in a variety of applications owing to being memory-efficient, being able to provide low-level control, and being portable.</p>

<h2>Historical Development of C</h2>
<p>C was developed to overcome the limitations of languages like B and BCPL. These languages had no real data typing capability, and their structured programming was on the primitive side. Dennis Ritchie began programming in C in 1972, as an effort to make UNIX both more portable and more functional. By 1973, the UNIX operating system was virtually rewritten in C, and we had complete system programming working in C.</p>

<p>Dennis Ritchie and Brian Kernighan published The C Programming Language, now referred to as the "K&R" book. It established the de facto standard for the C language. In that book, Ritchie and Kernighan defined C's syntax and semantics, also called "K&R C".</p>

<h3>Evolution</h3>
As C gained popularity, variations emerged across different compilers and platforms, necessitating standardization.
